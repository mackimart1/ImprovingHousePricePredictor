*Self-Improving House Price Predictor*

Overview
This repository implements a self-improving house price predictor using linear regression. The predictor loads data, trains a model, evaluates its performance, and saves the model. If the model's performance improves, it saves the new model; otherwise, it re-trains with more data.
Dependencies
NumPy (import numpy as np)
Pandas (import pandas as pd)
Scikit-learn (from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score)
Joblib (import joblib)
OS (import os)
Datetime (import datetime)
Class
SelfImprovingHousePricePredictor

*A class that represents the self-improving house price predictor.*

Represents the self-improving house price predictor.
__init__(data_file='house_data.csv', model_file='house_price_model.joblib'): Initializes the predictor with data and model files.
load_data(): Loads data from the file or creates synthetic data if the file doesn't exist.
preprocess_data(data): Preprocesses data by splitting it into training and testing sets.
train_model(X_train, y_train): Trains a linear regression model on the training data.
evaluate_model(X_test, y_test): Evaluates the model's performance using mean squared error and R2 score.
save_model(): Saves the trained model to the file.
load_model(): Loads the saved model from the file.
update_performance_history(mse, r2): Updates the performance history with the latest metrics.
run(): Runs the predictor, training and evaluating the model, and saving it if improved.
predict(features): Makes a prediction using the loaded model.


*Usage*

To use the predictor, simply run the script. The predictor will load data, train a model, evaluate its performance, and save the model. If the model's performance improves, it saves the new model; otherwise, it re-trains with more data.
Python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    predictor = SelfImprovingHousePricePredictor()
    for _ in range(5):  # Run the script multiple times to demonstrate self-improvement
        predictor.run()
        print("\n")

    # Make a prediction
    new_house = np.array([[2000, 3, 10]])  # size: 2000 sq ft, 3 bedrooms, 10 years old
    predicted_price = predictor.predict(new_house)
    print(f"Predicted price for new house: ${predicted_price[0]:,.2f}")


*Notes*

The predictor uses synthetic data if the file doesn't exist.
The model's performance is evaluated using mean squared error and R2 score.
The predictor saves the model if its performance improves.
The predictor re-trains with more data if the model's performance doesn't improve.
